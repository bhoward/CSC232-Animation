# Animation

This is a demonstration of using patterns such as Composite, Decorator, and
Observer to build a simple representation of animations (as a function from
time to image), along with a Swing-based viewer to display an animation.

It was created by Brian Howard for the DePauw course CSC 232, Object-Oriented
Software Development, in the spring of 2021.
